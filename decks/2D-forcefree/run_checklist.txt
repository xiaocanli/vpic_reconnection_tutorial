1. cfl_req, wpedt_max, mi_me, L_di, Ti_Te, vthe, wpe_wce, taui, quota
2. nppc, Lx, Ly, Lz, topology_x, topology_y, topology_z, nx, ny, nz
3. restart_interval, interval, fields_interval, ehydro_interval, Hhydro_interval, eparticle_interval
4. emax_band, emin_band, which can be ignored if nbands = 0.
   emax_spect, emin_spect, which are Lorentz factor - 1. Make sure they are reasonable.
5. nx_zone, ny_zone, nz_zone
6. stride_particle_dump
7. num_step
8. nparticles_per_proc
9. DUMP_DIR_FORMAT in reconnection.cc
10. Comment #define ENERGY_BAND_DIAGNOSTICS and set nbands to 0 if needed
11. Make sure that fields_interval and hydro_interval are set reasonable
    when dumping both previous and next time steps
12. Check whether macro definitions should be defined: HARRIS_SHEET, ELECTRONS_CARRRY_CURRENT,
    LOCAL_PERTURBATION, DUMP_THREE_SUCCESSIVE_STEPS, OPEN_BOUNDARY_CONDITIONS,
    TURBULENCE_MIXING_DIAGNOSTICS, WAVE_PERTURBATION, RELATIVISTIC_PLASMA
13. Check whether to define DUMP_WITH_HDF5 for dumping fields and hydro in HDF5 format.
    Check whether to define USE_VIOU for using Bin Dong's viou library instead of
    build-in HDF5 dump routines in VPIC.
14. Check whether to define SPECIES_ADVANCED_WITH_PART_EFIELD, SPECIES_ADVANCED_WITHOUT_EPERP,
    CHECK_PARTICLE_CROSSING_EGTB for test-particle components
15. Check whether to define ENABLE_RADIATION_REACTION for radiation reaction
16. Remember to set the stripe for particle and spectrum directory. When dumping fields and hydro
    in HDF5 format, it is better to set stripe for field_hdf5 and hydro_hdf5 as well.
    This may not be important if dumping data to burst buffer. It may even slow down the IO.

# Particle tracking
1. Make sure to change particle_tracking, particle_select, nframes_per_tracer_file,
   emf_at_tracer, hydro_at_tracer, num_emf, num_hydro
2. Make sure the sum of num_emf and num_hydro == TRACER_NUM_ADDED_FIELDS
3. tracer_dir in dumptracer_h5part.cc
4. Using line "int tag = ((((int)rank())<<19) | (itracer & 0x7ffff));" to set right number
of bits for MPI rank and tracer. Make sure that there are enough space for large 3D run
with a large number of MPI ranks. Note that 0x7ffff is "1111111111111111111" (19 ones).
So changing the number for rank (e.g. 19), make sure to change 0x7ffff as well.
For example, when (((int)rank())<<13), we need to change 0x7ffff to "0x1fff", which
corresponds to "1111111111111" (13 ones). This indicates to use 520k for MPI ranks and
8192 for tracer particle tags.

# Restart/restore
1. Remember that all restart files are saved in restore1 in the 3D production run,
   so we just overwrite the restart files.
2. We need to change the argument of advance_tracers, dump_tracer_restart, and
   read_tracer_restart to 1.

translate
1. create data/ directory (May not need to)
2. set strip size for data/ (May not need to)
3. output_format, MPI topology
4. MPI_INFO_SET (collective IO for larger job size)

run script:
1. stage_in and stage_out directories
2. setup the input and output directories
3. Comment stage_out lines for fields and hydro if not needed
4. Change project name
5. run directories in cori_knl_persistent.sh cori_translate.sh
6. topology in translate should match with PIC run
7. remember to create the run directory, e.g. $DW_PERSISTENT_STRIPED_reconnection/input

* Copy needed files to input
* Estimate how many BB are needed.
* Remember to stage_in Makefile and reconnection.cc, which will be used by translate
* Remember to set stripe size and count for all output directories on Lustre

Computing resources:
* Make sure that the memory is enough
* Make sure that the storage space is enough
* Create spectrum and particle directories and set stripe?
* Remember that each field and hydro dump include ghost cells

# Data needed for analysis
For fluid-based and particle-based analysis, we need
1. E and B at three steps. 6 * 3 = 18
2. n at three steps for two species. 1 * 3 * 2 = 6
3. v, u at three steps for two species. 6 * 3 * 2 = 36
4. p at one step for two species. 9 * 1 * 2 = 18
We also need current densities, although it can be easily calculated using velocities
and number densities. 4
So the total number of fields we need is 82, while we dumped 135 of them.
The fields that we do not need include
1. Magnetic field strength. 3
2. Current densities at previous and post steps. 4 * 2 = 8
3. Pressure tensor at previous and post steps. 9 * 2 * 2 = 36
4. Kinetic energy densities. 3 * 2 = 6
In total, 50 fields or hydro data are not needed.

# VPIC source code
1. Make sure that "#define DISABLE_DYNAMIC_RESIZING" in src/boundary/boundary_p.cc is commented,
especially for relativistic simulations.
